Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering are methods and tools for developing and maintenance of high quality software.
Importance in technology industry: it enabling the creation of software applications in various aspects of life such as communication, commerce and health care.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming language. e g fortran.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s.
The rise agile methodologies in the 2000s.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting users needs and system requirements.
Designs:creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and users interface.
implemtation: writing codes and building systems according to design specifications.
testing: To ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements using various testing tools.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
Maintaince: providing ongoing support and updates to the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Both models uses traditional and agile aim to deliver projects on time.
Agile promotes ongoing collaboration, while waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined steps.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plan.
Project manager: overseas the planing, execution and delivering of software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): it provides tools for writing, debugging and testing code. eg vistual studio.
Version Control System (VCS):it is a software tool use for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. eg Grit.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements
tight deadline and 
Technical debt.
the strategies of overcoming challenges are; effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components.
Integration: testing interaction between components and subsystem.
System testing: testing the entire software as a whole.
Acceptance testing: testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of quality control: it measures such as the code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration which help to identify defects in the devlopment process.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is all about the act of crafting out questions or statements to get the best possible response from Al models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"What is software developer?" why it's more effective is because it is clear, concise , complete and correct. And using keywords that guide the Al towards the kind of response you want.
